"A common (and useful) convention to use for the version name is the "
"revision number of the version control tool you're using to track your "
"Scrapy project code. For example: ``r23``. The versions are not compared "
"alphabetically but using a smarter algorithm (the same `distutils`_ uses)"
" so ``r10`` compares greater to ``r9``, for example."

"Scrapyd also runs multiple processes in parallel, allocating them in a "
"fixed number of slots given by the :ref:`max_proc` and "
":ref:`max_proc_per_cpu` options, starting as many processes as possible "
"to handle the load."

#: ../../overview.rst:31
msgid ""
"In addition to dispatching and managing processes, Scrapyd provides a "
":ref:`JSON web service <api>` to upload new project versions (as eggs) "
"and schedule spiders. This feature is optional and can be disabled if you"
" want to implement your own custom Scrapyd. The components are pluggable "
"and can be changed, if you're familiar with the `Twisted Application "
"Framework`_ which Scrapyd is implemented in."
